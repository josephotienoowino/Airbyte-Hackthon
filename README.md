## Personalized Email Marketing Dashboard
## Theme: Data App
**Description**: Use Airbyte to pull email campaign data from platforms like Mailchimp or SendGrid. Store the data in MotherDuck to unify performance metrics like open rates, click-through rates, and unsubscribes. Build a simple dashboard using Streamlit or React to visualize these metrics, identify trends, and suggest the best time to send emails based on past performance.
## Why It's Great:
- Easy to implement with readily available APIs.
- Focuses on aggregating and visualizing data without requiring complex AI models.
- Solves a real-world problem for small businesses or marketers.
